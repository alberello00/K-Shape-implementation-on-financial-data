# K-Shape-implementation-on-financial-data
In this project, I applied the K-Shape technique, which was introduced in the publication "k-Shape: Efficient and Accurate Clustering of Time Series" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2949741.2949758) by J.Paparizzos and L.Gravano, to a dataset of financial time series. The dataset was composed by the stocks of the "S&P 100".
